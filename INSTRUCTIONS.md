Instructions
==========

Starting
--------
* Download the [latest release](https://github.com/SchlossLab/new_project/releases/latest)
to the directory and decompress

* Rename the decompressed/untarred file to the name of your project. Name the
folder in the format `LastName_BriefDescription_Journal_Year`. For example,
"Kozich_MiSeqSOP_AEM_2013" will work. Move into the folder.

* Open the README.md document in an editor. Change the first line to
reflect the title of your research study, and the content from this section to
the end. You can, but are not obligated to keep the Acknowledgements section.
You should keep the directory tree

* In the directory tree of the README.md file, customize the comments to fit
your project. Update this tree as the project proceeds.

* At the terminal do the following to replace the license for the template's repository with the license for your project

  ```
  mv newproject_LICENSE.md LICENSE.md
  ```

* At the prompt type:

  ```
  git init ./
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  ```

* Go to the [SchlossLab repository](https://github.com/schlosslab) on GitHub and
create a new repository with the same name as your folder. Click the "Create
Repository" button.
* Follow the instructions for pushing an existing repository from the command
line. For example (be sure to replace `LastName_BriefDescription_Journal_Year`
with the appropriate text:

  ```
  git remote add origin https://github.com/SchlossLab/LastName_BriefDescription_Journal_Year.git
  git push -u origin master
  ```

* You will want to update the README file as you go through your work. It is
likely that you'll need to provide a link to the published paper, the title, the abstract of the study, and instructions for how to generate the paper.

* Once you understand all of this, you can run

  ```
  git rm INSTRUCTIONS.md
  git commit -m "Remove instructions document"
	```

Citations
----------------------

You should obviously think about where you want your work published. Various formatting files are available as `csl` files that will play nicely with rmakrdown, Word, and LaTeX. You can find these files at the [CSL GitHub repository](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles). As an example, we commonly use style guides for the [ASM Journals](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/search?q=asm&type=Code&utf8=âœ“)



Guiding themes
----------------------

The goal of this repository is transparency. All co-authors should be able to see the project develop and its history. They should also be able to leave comments in the issue tracker and file pull requests to add/improve analysis and  text. Once submitted, the repository will serve as an open notebook to readers that are interested in better understanding methods so that they can critique our work and hopefully use our analysis in their own work. Whether this repository is public prior to submission is left to the first author; however, once submitted, the repository will be made public.

As each project is developed, the lead author should approach the project from the perspective a future user seeking to reproduce their work. At the basic level, the goal is for anyone to be able to clone the repository and run `make write.paper` to reproduce the analysis. There are many reasons why this may be hard or even impossible, but this should always be the goal. To achieve this it is important to keep in mind several factors:

* **Automation:** All analysis should be automated and executed using `make`. This will make sure that all file dependencies are maintained.

* **Organization:** All analysis should be run from the project's root directory without using `cd`. To achieve this, relative and not absolute paths should be used.

* **Software:** Document all external software, links, citations, and version numbers in the README document. Also document where your Makefile expects this software to be installed.

* **All code lives in the code folder:** Any batch or R scripts should be in the `code/` folder. We do this to create a partition between code and data. Tests should be kept in the `code/tests` folder.

* **Keep code DRY:** Code should make use of functions to eliminate repetition.

* **Automate tests as much as possible:** `testthat` is a powerful R package for performing unit tests to make sure your functions perform as expected.

* **Set the random number generator seed:** Use `set.seed` in mothur and R to set the random number generator so that your analysis is reproducible.

* **The heavy computational lifting should be in scripts:** Long computations should generate an output file that has a rule in the Makefile. The output of these computations can be used in building figures and tables and in the manuscript's Rmd file.

* **No hardcoding numbers in text:** All numbers from your study that appear in the final manuscript should have been generated using R code in the Rmd file. Use the R `stopifnot` function to make sure you are generating the expected outputs from your Rmd file (e.g. number of significant OTUs).

* **Raw data should stay raw:** All raw data should live in `data/raw/`. This includes metadata received from collaborators and fastq data taken from the sequencer. Data should only be manipulated using code and outputted to a separate folder. Most of our sequence processing will be done using `mothur` and the intermediate files should be stored in `data/mothur/`.

* **Create tables in separate *.Rmd files:** The code and captions for tables should be stored in `results/tables/` and should be rendered to PDFs keeping the `TeX` formatted intermediate files.

* **Create figures in scripts:** The code for figures should be stored in `code/` and the output should be in the size and specifications set by the target journal.

* **Manuscript documents are stored in submission folder:** Manuscripts should use BibTeX and csl formatting. They should not use EndNote. The preferred output format is a PDF. Even if a journal requests a Word-formatted file for final acceptance, they likely accept TeX instead if asked.

* **Maintain as much of the exploratory phase as possible:** There is an exploratory folder for experimentation and maintaining notebooks for situations where it is not possible to automate an analysis. Everything in the scratch directory can be deleted at any time without negative impact.

* **Keep all analysis under version control:** Commit your code after any significant changes to your project. Push the code to the GitHub repository at least daily.
